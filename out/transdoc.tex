\subsection{formulas}



\LaTeX
 is very useful and
easy to use even without formulas. Graphics, tables,
cross-references of all kinds, bibliography and
index are no problem.

Formulas are a bit more difficult, yet here is a
simple example. Two of Einstein's
most famous formulas are:

\begin

\
m

\frac

\sqrt

\frac

\end

But if you don't write formulas, you don't need
to bother with them.
